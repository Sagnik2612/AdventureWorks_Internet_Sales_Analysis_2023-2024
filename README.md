# AdventureWorks_Internet_Sales_Analysis_2023-2024

##  Project Overview

This project addresses the demand for **modernized, interactive sales reporting** for AdventureWorks' Internet Sales division. Replacing static Excel sheets, we have built dynamic Power BI dashboards 
powered by SQL queries to track performance against budgets, identify top products/customers, and uncover actionable business insights.

The goal is to empower **Sales Managers and Sales Representatives** to:
- Understand sales trends over time
- Follow up on key clients and top-performing products
- Benchmark actual sales against budgets

**Tools Used**:  
- **Power BI** for visual analytics  
- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)** for data querying  

**Data Source**
**AdventureWorksDW2019** repository

##  Business Problem

AdventureWorks’ sales team previously relied on static reports, limiting their ability to take timely decisions. There was:
- **No easy comparison** of sales vs. budget
- **No quick visibility** of top-performing customers or products
- **No flexible filter mechanisms** for individual sales agents

**The Challenge**:  
To create **3 interactive dashboards** that would meet the needs of both the **Sales Manager** and **Sales Representatives**, using historical internet sales data from 2023–2024.
